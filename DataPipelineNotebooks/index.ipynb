    "\n",
    "This aspect of the tutorial will cover how you can obtain new weather input data for a new date range or region.  This part assumes you have avalanche forecast labels for the dates and region (OAP currently has historical forecast labels for three avalanche centers in the US from the 15-16 season through the 19-20 season and is working on expanding that).\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the large size of the input GFS data and the fact that its already hosted by NCAR OAP isn't currently providing copies of this data.  If you want to start a data processing pipeline from the original data you can start with this process here.  If you aren't interested in the data processing steps and only in the ML steps you can download the labels here: https://oapstorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/oap-training-data/Data/V1.1FeaturesWithLabels2013-2020.zip and a subset of training data here: https://oapstorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/oap-training-data/Data/MLDataWashington.zip and skip to the fourth notebook 4.TimeseriesAi\n",

    "\n",

In the below screenshot I've selected dates Nov 1, 2015 thorough April 30, 2016 for the 15-16 season.  The models assume the season starts Nov 1 and ends April 30 (it wouldn't be too difficult to update the data pipeline for a southern hemisphere winter but its not something I've done yet).\n",

    "    4. Select only the 3-24 hour forecasts in the gridded products as currently OAP doesn't use more than this.  \n",
    "    5. You can also then select the bounding box for the area you want to download. Once you have a bounding box you like write down the lat/lon values so its easier to input when we come back for other date ranges.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once the selections are correct and you can eventually click through to submit your request.  You should get a confirmation page of your selections and the system will start to retrieve your data.  This usually takes a few hours and you will get an email when its ready for download.  At this point if you want additional date/time ranges you can submit the requests and they will get queued and made avalable for download when they are ready.  In this example the downloaded files were 1.1 GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract and decompress all the files until you have a per forecast grib file and ensure all the files have been moved in to a single directory (per season per location). If you are using Linux this stackoverflow post may help https://askubuntu.com/questions/146634/shell-script-to-move-all-files-from-subfolders-to-parent-folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have all the files as grib files in a single directory for that date and location (i.e., 15-16/Washington/) there are a couple final cleaning steps.  Due to the download process sometimes some files earlier than 11/1 are included.  You can just delete those files (the file date is)\n",
    "    \n",
    "_Its worth a brief interlude in to understanding how these files are encoded.  Here is a typical file name gfs.0p25.2015110100.f003.grib2.chamberlin455705.  Lets break that down gfs: is the model we are using.  0p25 I beleive is the resolution at .25 degress but I haven't seen this documented.  2015110100 is the encoded date of the model runtime.  You will see in your dataset that there are four models run per day: 00, 06, 12, 18.  Currently we are only using the 00 model (the first of the day).  The next component is .f003 which is the forecast for 3 hours from the model runtime.  grib2 is the input file format.  chamberlin455705 is the enocded download request. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next delete all files which have a model run hour other than 00 (i.e., 06, 12, 18).  Check that you have 1456 files at this point (8 files per day for 182 days, my download is missing the last 4 files which isn't a big deal as a subsequent steps averages these hourly forecasts to daily forecasts).  The total size of the input files at this point is ~900MB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remove the download request label in the filename which is easily accomplished using the rename command.\n",

    "\n",
    "![File List Example](images/files_example2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is to ensure the input data is in the correct folder structure.  All data for this project will sit off a path you define as the base path.  The GFS input data then needs to be in subfolders of that path delineated by season and state (or country).\n",
    "For example if our past path in this example is:\n",

    "* There is an option to covert the file to NetCDF in the NCAR/UCAR UI.  Don't use this as it will result in a .nc file which isn't in the same format as the one we are going to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Transform and Filtering the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the input file set we can start to go through the initial data pipeline steps to transform and filter the data. Today this is done in a series of Jupyter notebooks.  This format makes it easy to incrementally process and check the outputs while the project is in a development phase (once we have a model which seems to have a resonable output these steps will be encoded in a set of python modules and implemented as a processing pipeline).\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have Anaconda and Jupyter installed first change directory to the Environments directory at the root level of the repo.  This contains two conda envrionment definitions, one for the processing steps, pangeo_small.yml, and one for the deep learning step, timeseriesai.yml.\n",

    "\n",
    "    conda activate pangeo_small\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one step we need to take before going through the notebooks and that is converting the grib2 files to NetCDF.  We do this for a couple of reasons but primarily that using this tool efficiently collapses the vertical dimensions (called level) in to the variable definitions so we can more easily get it to the ML format we need.  The utility to do this is called wgrib2 and should have been installed in the pangeo_small environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a terminal prompt change directory to the folder where you downloaded and unpacked the weather model files.  \n",

    "Completing these next few steps bascially takes the raw input weather data and leaves us with data slightly transformed but filtered to only the coordinates in the avalanche regions for that location.  For example here is what a regional view of one of the parameters (U component of wind vector) looks like when both interpolated 4x and viewed across the entire Washington region:\n",

    "#### Converting the data in to a memmapped numpy timeseries (samples, feature, timestep)\n",
    "This step needs to be run once to create a dataset to be used in a subsequent ML step.  The way to think about these methods is that we use the set of valid labels + the valid lat/lon pairs as an index in to the data.  Its important to understand the regions are geographically large and usually cover many lat/lon pairs in our gridded dataset while the labels apply to an entire region (multiple lat/lon pairs).  For example the _WA Cascades East, Central_ region coveres 24 lat/lon pairs so if on Jan 1 there was a label we wanted to predict our dataset would have 24 lat/lon pairs in that region associated with that label.  There are pros and cons for this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "1. Reasonable data augmentation approach\n",
    "2. Aligns with how we utltimatly want to provide predictions--more granular, not restricted to established regions\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "1. Could be contributing to overfitting\n",
    "2. The data becomes very large\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said the methods will calculate this index for every label/lat/lon point and then we'll split this in to train and test sets.

The 4.TimeseriesAi notebook in the ML folder is only to demonstrate the process to do this as today the results are a proof of concept and not sophisticated at all.  This area has only had minimal investment to date and is where focus is now being applied.  The current issue is overfitting and that will need to be addresssed before both exapnding the dataset size or training for additional epochs.\n",
